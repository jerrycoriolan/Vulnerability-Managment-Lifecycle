# Vulnerability Management Lifecycle in Sandbox

![VM Lifecyle](https://github.com/jerrycoriolan/Vulnerability-Management-Lifecycle/assets/168882662/c66bf82e-7dc5-49bd-80fd-2b86fbf298ce)


## Introduction

In this project, I built a vulnerability management lab where I installed Nessus Essentials and a Windows VM in Microsoft Azure. I then installed old, deprecated software on the Windows 10 virtual machine and ran vulnerability scans to discover any vulnerabilities on it. I will then remediate, observe, rescan, and show the results below.

- Windows virtual machine in Azure
- Install Nessus
- Turn off Windows firewall and NSG in Azure  
- Adding the virtual machine for a non-credential scan 
- Observe vulnerabilities
- Configure the virtual machine and Nessus for credential scan
- Observe results and remediate
- Rescan and observe
- Sample Vulnerability Policy to point to

## Vulnerability Management Policy 
 This sample policy is a high-level overview of the necessary requirements to identify, classify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

In this project, I installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts. I implemented a vulnerability management function on a sandbox network to discover, prioritize, assess, report, remediate, and verify vulnerabilities. Lastly, I conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus and remediated vulnerabilities.
