## Introduction

In this project, I built a vulnerability management lab where I validated all assets in scope for an organization and viewed Qualys scan results to view critical and high vulnerabilities that I would then send over to owners for remediation. I then installed Nessus Essentials, a Windows VM in Microsoft Azure, deployed old, deprecated software on a Windows 10 virtual machine, and ran vulnerability scans to discover any vulnerabilities. I will then remediate, observe, rescan, and show the results below.

- Asset Validation
- Windows virtual machine in Azure
- Install Nessus
- Turn off Windows firewall and NSG in Azure  
- Adding the virtual machine for a non-credential scan 
- Observe vulnerabilities
- Configure the virtual machine and Nessus for credential scan
- Observe results and remediate
- Rescan and observe
- Sample Vulnerability Policy to point to

 Now, I downloaded outdated software and configured the virtual machine and scan to run credential scans; the results are shown below.

## Vulnerability Management Policy 
 This sample policy is a high-level overview of the necessary requirements to identify, classify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

First, we want to set up third-party and Windows OS patching for testing and deployment, dealing with vulnerabilities that can be easily fixed by automated patching and a secure build standard.  I installed and configured Nessus Essentials in this project to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts. I implemented a vulnerability management function on a sandbox network to discover, prioritize, assess, report, remediate, and verify vulnerabilities. Lastly, I conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus and remediated vulnerabilities.
